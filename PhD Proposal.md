## Data Driven Metrics Applied to Traffic Crashes to Improve Observability in Smart Cities

Smart Cities are intended to be highly-connected digital cities with massive amount of Data from IoT, sensors and historical data. 
Smart Mobility solutions can benefit from real-time and historical data to better understand events and use this informationto reduce traffic congestion.  

### ODDBU Methodology
Supports the undestanding of data in a meaningful way and thus, supports the observability of smart cities.

# Enabled Network Monitoring and Measurement: Toward High-Yield Network Obserability for Digital Twin

![[Pasted image 20250502170506.png]]

### Active Measurement
Actively sending data packets to test the networks, however this can create a sort of Heisenberg effect, where the act of observing the network can affect the accurancy of measurement result.

### Passive Measurement
Networking monitoring involves capturing informations about the system, using logs traces and network sniffing.

The problem with Passive Measurement is that it cannot provide real-time data on network performance and may not capture as much detail as active monitoring.

### Hybrid Measurement
This kind of technique combines both active and passive measurement techniques to provide a more comprehensive view of network performace.

# Patera

Goal of Industry 4.0: 
- Make assembly lines machine and sensors data available outside of the industrial plant offering possibilities of advanced coordination within separated industries.

Concept of "Servization" -> the economic and functional enhancement of the produced goods by offering additional services that improve customer experience related to the product itself.

# Human Machine Interface in Concept of Industry 4.0


### HMI 1.0
The first type of HMI were control rooms where buttons, diodes and clock indicators worked together
### HMI 2.0
The second revolution in HMI is desktop visualization and visualization on touch panels. 
### HMI 3.0
Internet connectivty and web servers in companies open possibilities for web and mobile applications. 
### HMI 4.0
Use of Machine Learning to react to events taking place inside the industrial plants using control system. Use of Virtual Reality and Augmented reality, this is the reason for developing the intelligent space


# Smart Cities with Digital Twin Systems for Disaster Management:
https://ascelibrary.org/doi/full/10.1061/%28ASCE%29ME.1943-5479.0000779

Communities Experience disasters in four phases: mitigation, preparation, response and recovery.

Mitigation and Preparations are the ongoing operations
The response evolves over days and weeks and recovery evolves over months and years. 

The digital twins can be a useful instrument to forecast and analyze the response to disasters from the populations

An example: 
In the response and recovery phases, data collection is applied to existing community conditions to develop images that are used in mental or formal simulation models to forecast conditions that will occurr if different possible decisions are made.
These result in decision that lead to actions and changes in community conditions.
Smart cities digital twin can improve all four phases of a community disaster experience.
In the mitigation phase SCDT can be used to evaluate alternative policies and plans to reduce loss of life and property and can thereby guide community leaders in disaster management.

In preparation phase SCDT can be used to collect and analyze near-real-time data about communicty and disaster event conditions. 

The iterative nature of disaster management provides a particularly fertile environment for the development and application of SCDT. 
Disaster management can be investigated from multiple perspectives based on the number of communities, number of disasters, type of resources or other characteristics. By looking at a single community through the lens of a single disaster, SCDT can be focused to provide improved tools to move through the disaster management cycle.

**Literature Review**

Disaster management models that describe a recommended process through a single disaster abound.
These high-level one-pass models focus on planning and do not "close the loop" through actions and changes in community conditions to address the iterative and adaptive nature of actual disaster management conditions to address the iterative and adaptive nature of actual disaster management.

Models of disaster management that are relevant to the current work include those that address an evolving disaster experience and address multiple infrastructure systems.

This requires an iterative model of repeated and adaptive decision-making that reflect the role of information in those decisions. Only few disaster managment  models reflect this iterative process.
For example, the Asian Disaster Preparedness Centre (ADPC) said, “It is important to consider recovery as a continuum rather than as a distinct phase of the disaster management cycle” (ADPC 2015), and it uses its Asian Disaster  
Preparedness Mode.

**See Sterman (2000) for a description of  causal loop diagram modeling.**

![[Pasted image 20250508104021.png]]
**In Atlanta, a virtual reality–based digital twin has been developed that allows**  
**for the investigation of human interactions with infrastructure**  
**(Mohammadi and Taylor 2017).**


In summary, most disaster management models fail to address  
one or both of the following: iterative disaster management proc-  
esses or community infrastructure interactions. SCDT can help ad-  
dress both gaps. A fully developed SCDT could provide integrated  
community-level data, images, and simulation, thereby closing the  
disaster management loop virtually, and thereby improving fore-  
casting of the outcomes of anticipated actions and providing feed-  
back on the impacts of actions taken.

### Smart Cities
In smart cities the system must use ICT sensors to provide real-time data in a way that leaders or the public can interpret to make decisions. The autonomous requirement distinguishes smart city systems from historical man-in-the-loop systems that depend on humans to manually collect data. Autonomy is particularly important in the application of the smart city concept to disaster management because humans are often unable to carry out functions during and after disaster owing to an inability to get to required measurement locations or information centers.
To better meet these definitional needs, as used here, smart cities  
are communities that use ICT to autonomously sense, store, and  
make current information on community conditions that is easily  
available to community leaders and citizen

## Digital Twin
Therefore, interinfrastructure digital twins can provide much  
more value than single-system digital twins alone. For example,  
a flooding/transportation digital twin that provides both available  
egress routes and alternatives to flooded roadways is more valuable  
than a flood map and flooding predictions alone or a roadway map  
and traffic congestion forecasts alone.
To better meet these definitional needs, as used here, digital  
twins are community images and simulations of infrastructures that  
can be used to present current and forecast future conditions in  
ways that improve decision-making and future conditions

## Smart City Digital Twin
A SCDT brings together smart city and digital twin technologies  
into a single platform. However, a distinction between smart city  
and digital twin functions is important for evaluating SCDT use and  
improving SCDT development.

To support community disaster management, a SCDT must use current data  
(smart city) to drive a simulation (digital twin) that allows decision  
makers to assess and evaluate potential future conditions based on  
current conditions and possible impacts of decisions.

To better meet these definitional needs, as used here, a SCDT is  
a system of ICT sensors that develop data sets integrated into dig-  
ital twin models that provide a dynamic ability to assess the future  
impacts of current conditions and strategies in ways that improve  
decision-making to achieve desired future results.
